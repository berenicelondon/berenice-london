# ✅ GitHub Workflows Issues - RESOLVED

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### ✅ **Issue 1: Branch Synchronization - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Workflows were on `master` branch but default branch was `main`
**Impact**: Workflows not triggering automatically
**Solution**: Changed default branch to `master` where all workflows are located

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Changed repository default branch from `main` to `master`
- ✅ Verified workflow files are accessible on default branch
- ✅ Confirmed GitHub can find all 6 workflow files
- ✅ Tested manual workflow triggering capability

**Result**: ✅ **FIXED** - Workflows now accessible on default branch

---

### ⚠️ **Issue 2: Missing GitHub Secrets - IN PROGRESS**

**Problem**: All 8 required secrets missing for automated deployments
**Impact**: Workflows will fail without proper authentication tokens
**Solution**: Created comprehensive secrets setup system

**Tools Created**:
- ✅ Interactive setup script: `./scripts/setup-secrets.sh`
- ✅ Detailed setup guide: `SECRETS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- ✅ Workflow status checker: `./scripts/check-workflows.sh`

**Required Secrets**:
```
❌ NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN (needed for Netlify deployments)
❌ NETLIFY_SITE_ID (needed for Netlify deployments)
❌ VERCEL_TOKEN (needed for Vercel deployments)
❌ VERCEL_ORG_ID (needed for Vercel deployments)
❌ VERCEL_PROJECT_ID (needed for Vercel deployments)
❌ NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (needed for payments)
❌ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (needed for payments)
❌ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (needed for payments)
```

**Result**: 🔧 **READY TO CONFIGURE** - All tools and guides prepared
